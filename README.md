# CSC550FinalProject - Zaxxon
 This is my Final Project for CSC 550 - Graphics Programming. It is a rebuilt version of the arcade game Zaxxon that has been programmed in Python. The player flies through a brief level in an isometric 3D space, with destructable barriers and guns that shoot back at the player. PyGame and OpenGL modules are required to play it.
